<p>Zoe is a current MiST student at Mcgill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
  They are from Dartmouth, NS originally and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Their 
  undergraduate studies were in Philosophy and English Literature, with some 
  specialization in Digital Humanities. They enjoy going to the movies, live theatre, 
  live music, and hosting shabbat dinners with their friends.</p>
<p>Zoe’s professional focus began in archives, as they did some undergraduate work with rare books. 
Since starting the program they have pivoted towards data science, taking courses on web design 
and database management. They enjoy working in archives and libraries, both of which they’ve 
done on a volunteer basis. They love linking information to user needs and mending gaps in 
the systems that make information less accessible. They’re eager to gain more experience 
and expand their portfolio.</p>

  <p> Focus in Philosophy </p>
  <p> Focus in Digital Humanities </p>
  Skills:
  <ul>

  I went to Carleton right after highschool and graduated in 4 years. My last year was online due to Covid. I took extra courses in the summer of 2021 and a lighter load during the fall and winter semesters. 
  The Hums program was small, allowing me to have a more personal relationship with my professors, who also graded my work themselves. I have many fond memories of my time there.

<h2><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/sis/programs/mist">Master’s of Information Science</a> - Mcgill University</h2>
  <p>2023-ongoing</p>
  <p>Currently completed all required core courses, as well as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Classification & Cataloguing</li>
    <li>Archival Principles & Practice</li>
  <p>[Add GPA? Must find. Is good!]
<p>I decided to enrol in the MiST a few years after moving to Quebec because I was looking forward to my future career goals. I quickly fell in love with the program, my peers, and the communities surrounding the information science profession. I was especially intrigued by the long history of information science, which has grown alongside person-to-person communication technologies over the last century. It’s no small task to keep up with, and keep sane within.</p>

<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<h2>Philosophy for Children</h2>
<p>As part of a blended undergraduate/graduate seminar class in the philosophy department, me and my colleagues designed and implemented a series of workshops for teaching philosophy to children via picture books. My book is pictured on the right. 
  <img src="Assets/IMG/0150501300101_15.jpg" alt="intro photo" style="float:center">
</p>
<p>I worked under the guidance of Dr. Melissa Frankel at Carleton University. You can read more about P4C here.</p>

<h2>Hertog Fellowship</h2>
<p>During the summer of 2021, I had the honour of being selected to participate in fellowship with the Hertog Foundation, a private educational organization based out of Washington, D.C. I participated in the summer course “Free Speech in a Fractured Republic” led by Martha Bayles. I was recommended for the program by Dr. Geoffrey C. Kellow.</p>

<h2>CALL/ACBD Conference Volunteer</h2>
<p>During the summer of 2024, I was able to attend <a href="url">the Canadian Association of Law Libraries</a> Annual Conference as one of their student volunteers, alongside a law student and the conference planning staff. I observed the keynote given by Tom Mulcair and learned about the current debates and initiatives going on in the field of law librarianship. Some of the talks I most enjoyed were:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Generating Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence for Legal Research and Writing </li>
<li>Democratizing Legal Knowledge Promoting Open Publishing for Secondary Legal Materials</li>
<li>Le langage simple principes de communication et initiatives de la Cour suprême</li>
<li>New Canadian Open Access Legal (COAL) Citation Guide / Lancement du Guide canadien de la référence juridique en accès libre (RJAL)</li>
</ul>

<h>CIRFA Cataloguing</h>
<p>Under the guidance of <a href="url">Christine Jacobs</a>, me and a team of student volunteers made headway in cataloguing the collection of texts held by the Centre Internationaliste Ryerson Fondation Aubin. The collection consisted mainly of books owned by Stanley Bréhaut Ryerson, and some works donated by his friends and colleagues. The mandate of the foundation is to “entend contribuer au décloisonnement des espaces de production de la pensée progressiste et du savoir engagé.” </p>
<p>
This project used the OPALS automated library system. Over the summer, my colleagues and I filled out MARC records in this system according to RDA cataloguing standards. We did a combination of original and copy cataloguing, and also took care to create subject headings in both LCSH and RVM to preserve equal access regardless of language. Although we did not complete the cataloguing of the entire collection, we made great improvements, and learned a lot about the ins and outs of library cataloguing. </p>
<p>This project occurred over the summer of 2024. </p>

<h2>MUHC Tanguay fonds</h2>
<p>Since Winter 2023, I’ve been contributing to <a href="url">the MUHC Arts & Heritage Center</a>, as well as the MUHC permanent archives. My work has consisted in a variety of odd jobs, including digitization and description. My largest project to date has been the weeding, description, and digitization of the fonds of Jean-Claude Tanguay, an artist and illustrator who created materials for the Montreal Children’s Hospital for many years. This project is ongoing under the supervision of archivist <a href="url">William Jones.</a></p>
