<p>Zoe is a current MiST student at Mcgill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
  They are from Dartmouth, NS originally and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Their 
  undergraduate studies were in Philosophy and English Literature, with some 
  specialization in Digital Humanities. They enjoy going to the movies, live theatre, 
  live music, and hosting shabbat dinners with their friends. </p>
<p>Zoe’s professional focus began in archives, as they did some undergraduate work with rare books. 
Since starting the program they have pivoted towards data science, taking courses on web design 
and database management. They enjoy working in archives and libraries, both of which they’ve 
done on a volunteer basis. They love linking information to user needs and mending gaps in 
the systems that make information less accessible. They’re eager to gain more experience 
and expand their portfolio. </p>

  I went to Carleton right after highschool and graduated in 4 years. My last year was online due to Covid. I took extra courses in the summer of 2021 and a lighter load during the fall and winter semesters. 
  The Hums program was small, allowing me to have a more personal relationship with my professors, who also graded my work themselves. I have many fond memories of my time there.

<h2>Master’s of Information Science - Mcgill University</h2>
  <p>2023-ongoing</p>
  <p>Currently completed all required core courses, as well as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Classification & Cataloguing</li>
    <li>Archival Principles & Practice</li>
  <p>[Add GPA? Must find. Is good!]
<p>I decided to enrol in the MiST a few years after moving to Quebec because I was looking forward to my future career goals. I quickly fell in love with the program, my peers, and the communities surrounding the information science profession. I was especially intrigued by the long history of information science, which has grown alongside person-to-person communication technologies over the last century. It’s no small task to keep up with, and keep sane within.</p>
