          <p>Zoe is a current MIST student at Mcgill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
          They are from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia originally and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Their 
          undergraduate studies were in Philosophy and English Literature, with some 
          specialization in Digital Humanities. They enjoy going to the movies, live theatre, 
          live music, and hosting shabbat dinners with their friends. They also do some amateur photography. 
          The images on this website are all their original work. </p>

          <p>Zoe’s professional focus began in archives, as they did some undergraduate work with rare books. 
          Since starting the program they have pivoted towards data science, taking courses on web design 
          and database management. They enjoy working in archives and libraries, both of which they’ve 
          done fairly extensively on a volunteer basis. They love linking information to user needs and mending gaps in 
          the systems that make information less accessible. They’re eager to gain more experience 
          and expand their portfolio. </p>

              I decided to enrol in the MIST a few years after moving to Montreal because I was looking forward to my future career goals. 
              I quickly fell in love with the program, my peers, and the communities surrounding the information science profession. 
              I was especially intrigued by the long history of information science, which has grown alongside person-to-person communication 
              technologies over the last century. It’s no small task to keep up with, and keep sane within.

            I went to Carleton directly out of high school, graduating in 4 years. My last year was online due to Covid. The Hums program was small, allowing me to have a more personal relationship with my professors, who provided ample feedback and allowed my writing and research skills to grow in leaps and bounds. I have many fond memories of my time there.

              picture books. My book is pictured on the right.

          a law student and the conference planning staff. I observed the keynote given by Tom Mulcair and

      <h2>CIRFA Cataloguing</h2> 
        <p>Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-jacobs-b090484?originalSubdomain=ca">Christine Jacobs</a>, 
        me and a team of student volunteers made headway in cataloguing the collection of texts held by the 
        <a href="https://centreinternationalisterfa.org/">Centre Internationaliste Ryerson Fondation Aubin.</a> 
        The collection consisted mainly of books owned by Stanley Bréhaut Ryerson, and some works donated by his 
        friends and colleagues. The mandate of the foundation is to “entend contribuer au décloisonnement des 
        espaces de production de la pensée progressiste et du savoir engagé.”</p>
        <p>This project used the OPALS automated library system. Over the summer, my colleagues and I filled 
        out MARC records in this system according to RDA cataloguing standards. We did a combination of 
        original and copy cataloguing, and also took care to create subject headings in both LCSH and RVM 
        to preserve equal access regardless of language. Although we did not complete the cataloguing of 
        the entire collection, we made great improvements, and learned a lot about the ins and outs of 
        library cataloguing.</p>
        <p>This project occurred over the summer of 2024.</p>

      in a variety of odd jobs, including digitization and description. My largest project to date

In this position I have been responsible for drafting a weekly newsletter, managing the MISSA social media accounts, and updating the MISSA webpage</p>
          <p>In this role, I have the honour of working closely with the School's adminstration and faculty, as we attempt to support eachother to meet the needs and expectations of the student body. I have also completed several web standards trainings in order to edit the MISSA webpage.

        <p>Beginning in the Winter 2025 term, I start a cataloguing project with the Canadian Center for Architecture,
          a museum and research center here in Montreal. The CCA's unique collections and rotating exhibits draw a variety of 
          visitors to the site, from academics, to architects, to artists. This project will consist in original and copy catloaguing of their library collections, primarily monographs. It will also involve the revision of existing records. The practicum will give me the opportunity to interview and shadow various staff members at the CCA, and gain experience in museum adminstration.</p>
