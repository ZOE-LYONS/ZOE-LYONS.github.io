        <div>
          <p>Zoe is a current MIST student at Mcgill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
          They are from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia originally and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Their 
          undergraduate studies were in Philosophy and English Literature, with some 
          specialization in Digital Humanities. They enjoy going to the movies, live theatre, 
          live music, and hosting shabbat dinners with their friends. They also do some amateur photography. 
          The images on this website are all their original work. </p>

          <p>Zoe’s professional focus began in archives, as they did some undergraduate work with rare books. 
          Since starting the program they have pivoted towards data science, taking courses on web design 
          and database management. They enjoy working in archives and libraries, both of which they’ve 
          done fairly extensively on a volunteer basis. They love linking information to user needs and mending gaps in 
          the systems that make information less accessible. They’re eager to gain more experience 
          and expand their portfolio. </p>

    <p>I decided to enrol in the MiST a few years after moving to Montreal because I was looking forward to my future career goals. I quickly fell in love with the program, my peers, and the communities surrounding the information science profession. I was especially intrigued by the long history of information science, which has grown alongside person-to-person communication technologies over the last century. It’s no small task to keep up with, and keep sane within.</p>

        <p>I went to Carleton directly out of highschool, graduating in 4 years. My last year was online due to Covid. The Hums program was small, allowing me to have a more personal relationship with my professors, who provided ample feedback and allowed my writing and research skills to grow in leaps and bounds. I have many fond memories of my time there.</p>

  <h1 id="section-3">Notable Projects</h1>
    <img src="Assets/IMG/IMG_9764.jpg" class="col-md-5 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="the voyage by Veronica Selinas">

      <h2>Philosophy for Children</h2>
        <p>As part of a blended undergraduate/graduate seminar class in the philosophy department, me and my 
          colleagues designed and implemented a series of workshops for teaching philosophy to children via 
          picture books. My book is pictured on the right. 
        </p>
        <p>I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://carleton.ca/philosophy/people/frankel-melissa/">
          Dr. Melissa Frankel</a> at Carleton University. You can read more about P4C <a href=
          "https://p4c.com/about-p4c/">here.</a></p>
        <p>This project occured in the winter of 2021.</p>

  <h2>Hertog Fellowship</h2>
    <p>During the summer of 2021, I had the honour of being selected to participate in fellowship with 
      the Hertog Foundation, a private educational organization based out of Washington, D.C. I participated 
      in the summer course <a href="https://hertogfoundation.org/courses/free-speech-in-a-fractured-republic">“Free Speech in a Fractured Republic”</a> led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Bayles">Martha Bayles.</a> I was recommended for the program by <a href="https://carleton.ca/chum/people/geoffrey-kellow/">Dr. Geoffrey C. Kellow.</a></p>

  <h2>CALL/ACBD Conference Volunteer</h2>
    <p>During the summer of 2024, I was able to attend <a href="https://callacbd.ca/about">the Canadian 
      Association of Law Libraries</a> Annual Conference as one of their student volunteers, alongside 
      a law student and the conference planning staff. I observed the keynote given by Tom Mulcair and 
      learned about the current debates and initiatives going on in the field of law librarianship. Some 
      of the talks I most enjoyed were:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>Generating Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence for Legal Research and Writing </li>
        <li>Democratizing Legal Knowledge Promoting Open Publishing for Secondary Legal Materials</li>
        <li>Le langage simple principes de communication et initiatives de la Cour suprême</li>
        <li>New Canadian Open Access Legal (COAL) Citation Guide / Lancement du Guide canadien de 
          la référence juridique en accès libre (RJAL)</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>CIRFA Cataloguing</h2> 
  <img src="Assets/IMG/015050130009.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="photo from the CIRFA Office">
    <p>Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-jacobs-b090484?originalSubdomain=ca">Christine Jacobs</a>, me and a team of student volunteers made headway in cataloguing the collection of texts held by the <a href="https://centreinternationalisterfa.org/">Centre Internationaliste Ryerson Fondation Aubin.</a> The collection consisted mainly of books owned by Stanley Bréhaut Ryerson, and some works donated by his friends and colleagues. The mandate of the foundation is to “entend contribuer au décloisonnement des espaces de production de la pensée progressiste et du savoir engagé.”</p>
    
    <p>This project used the OPALS automated library system. Over the summer, my colleagues and I filled 
    out MARC records in this system according to RDA cataloguing standards. We did a combination of 
    original and copy cataloguing, and also took care to create subject headings in both LCSH and RVM 
    to preserve equal access regardless of language. Although we did not complete the cataloguing of 
    the entire collection, we made great improvements, and learned a lot about the ins and outs of 
    library cataloguing.</p>

    <p>This project occurred over the summer of 2024.</p>

  <h2>MUHC Tanguay fonds</h2>
    <p>Since Fall 2023, I’ve been contributing to <a href="https://muhc.ca/art-and-heritage">the 
    MUHC Arts & Heritage Center</a>, as well as the MUHC permanent archives. My work has consisted 
    in a variety of odd jobs, including digitization and description. My largest project to date 
    has been the weeding, description, and digitization of the fonds of Jean-Claude Tanguay, an 
    artist and illustrator who created materials for the Montreal Children’s Hospital for many years. 
    This project is ongoing under the supervision of archivist 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamjones2/?originalSubdomain=ca">William Jones.</a></p>

  <h2>CCA Cataloguing Practicum</h2>
  <p>Beginning in the Winter 2025 term, I start a cataloguing project with the Canadian Center for Architecture,
    a museum and research center here in Montreal. The CCA's unique collections and rotating exhibits draw a variety of 
    visitors to the site, from academics, to architects, to artists. This project will consist in original and copy catloaguing of their library collections, primarily monographs. It will also involve the revision of existing 
    records. The practicum will give me the opportunity to interview and shadow various staff members at the CCA, 
    and gain experience in museum adminstration.
